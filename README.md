## jsx

### What is JSX, and how is it different from HTML?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and is primarily used to structure the UI in React applications. However, JSX is not valid HTML or JavaScript, so it must be transpiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel before the browser can process it.

**Key Differences**:
- **JavaScript Logic**: JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}`. This means you can dynamically insert values or logic directly into the markup.
- **Strict Syntax**: Unlike HTML, JSX enforces that all elements must be properly closed, including self-closing tags like `<img />` and `<br />`.
- **Attribute Naming**: In JSX, attributes like `class` and `for` are written as `className` and `htmlFor` to avoid conflicts with JavaScript keywords.

This is much more powerful than plain HTML because it allows you to combine UI with dynamic data directly.

**Why Use JSX?**  
JSX simplifies how we write UI components by allowing us to blend JavaScript and markup. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, especially when building complex, dynamic applications where UI needs to change based on data.

**Example**:
Let’s say we want to greet a user by name. With JSX, you can easily embed JavaScript logic inside the UI like this:

```jsx
const user = "Jane";
return <h1>Welcome, {user}!</h1>; // Embeds JavaScript logic into JSX
```

## Virtual DOM

### What is the Virtual DOM, and how does React use it?

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to improve performance and efficiency when rendering UI updates. Instead of directly manipulating the real DOM, React updates the Virtual DOM first. Once the changes are made, React compares (or "diffs") the new Virtual DOM with the previous version, and only the parts that have changed are updated in the real DOM. This process is called **reconciliation**.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Performance**: By updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed, React avoids costly full-page re-renders, making updates faster.
- **Efficiency**: React reduces unnecessary DOM manipulations, improving overall app performance by minimizing direct interactions with the real DOM.

**Example**:  
Let’s say you have a list of items and only one item changes. Instead of re-rendering the entire list, React will update only the specific item that changed in the real DOM after making the changes in the Virtual DOM first.

```jsx
const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

// Only the changed item gets updated in the real DOM.
function updateItem(index, newItem) {
  const updatedItems = [...items];
  updatedItems[index] = newItem;
  return updatedItems;
}
```

## Reconciliation in React

### What is Reconciliation in React?

Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the real DOM efficiently. When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous version. This comparison (or "diffing") allows React to determine what has changed. Instead of updating the entire DOM, React only updates the parts that have changed, making the process much faster and more efficient.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Minimal Updates**: React calculates the smallest number of changes needed and applies them, reducing the performance cost of full DOM updates.
- **Optimized Rendering**: By updating only the affected parts of the UI, React ensures that the application runs smoothly even with frequent updates.

**Example**:  
Imagine you have a shopping cart, and you update the quantity of one item. Instead of re-rendering the entire cart, React will only update the specific item whose quantity changed.

```jsx
const cart = [
  { name: 'Apple', quantity: 1 },
  { name: 'Banana', quantity: 2 }
];

// Only the updated item in the cart will be rendered again
function updateQuantity(index, newQuantity) {
  const updatedCart = [...cart];
  updatedCart[index].quantity = newQuantity;
  return updatedCart;
}
```

## Props vs State

4. **What are props and state in React? (props vs state)**

   - **Props:** Passed from parent components to child components. They are immutable and used to pass data to components.
   - **State:** Managed within the component itself, allowing it to change over time. It is mutable and typically updated using hooks like `useState`.

   | Props                          | State                          |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
   | Immutable                       | Mutable                        |
   | Managed by Parent Component     | Managed by the Component        |
   | Used for Passing Data           | Used for Local Data             |
   | Triggers Re-render on Parent Update | Triggers Re-render on State Change |

## useState vs useEffect

5. **Explain the difference between `useState` and `useEffect` in React.**

   - **useState:** A hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update that state.
   - **useEffect:** A hook used for side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM. It runs after the render and can run based on dependency changes.

   | useState                         | useEffect                       |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Used to create state              | Used to handle side effects      |
   | Triggers a re-render on state update | Runs after every render unless controlled by a dependency array |
   | No dependencies                   | Can depend on state or props     |

## Higher-Order Components (HOC)

6. **What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React?**

   A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. It is used to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying them directly.

   **Key Points:**
   - HOCs do not modify the original component; they wrap it.
   - Commonly used for concerns like authentication, analytics, or state management.

---

## useCallback vs useMemo

7. **What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?**

   - **useCallback:** Returns a memoized function. It is used when you want to pass a stable function reference to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - **useMemo:** Returns a memoized value. It is used to cache expensive calculations so they don’t re-run on every render.

   | useCallback                      | useMemo                         |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Memoizes a function               | Memoizes a value                |
   | Prevents re-renders of child components | Avoids running expensive calculations |

## Redux

8. **What is Redux, and why is it used?**

   Redux is a state management library often used with React. It provides a centralized store to manage the entire application's state, making it easier to manage and debug state changes across large applications.

   **Key Concepts:**
   - **Store:** Holds the entire state of the application.
   - **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes.
   - **Reducers:** Functions that take the current state and an action, then return the new state.

## Redux Thunk

9. **What is Redux Thunk?**

   Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write asynchronous logic in Redux. Thunk enables you to dispatch functions (thunks) that contain asynchronous code such as API calls, alongside your synchronous actions.

---

## Class Components vs Functional Components

10. **What is the difference between class components and functional components in React?**

   | Class Components                 | Functional Components           |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Uses `this` to access state/props | Uses hooks like `useState`       |
   | Requires more boilerplate         | Simpler, less code               |
   | Lifecycle methods for side effects | Hooks like `useEffect` handle side effects |

---

## Hooks in React

11. **Can you explain how hooks work in React?**

   Hooks are functions that allow you to use React’s state and lifecycle features inside functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

 ---

## useEffect vs Lifecycle Methods

12. **Why do we need `useEffect`, and how does it differ from lifecycle methods?**

   `useEffect` in functional components can mimic several lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` from class components. It provides a unified API to manage side effects.

---

## Limitations of the Virtual DOM

13. **What are the limitations of React’s Virtual DOM?**

   - Large trees can slow down the diffing process.
   - Complex reconciliations can overwhelm the Virtual DOM’s efficiency.
   - Additional memory usage due to maintaining an in-memory representation.

---

## useCallback and Performance

14. **How does `useCallback` help with performance in React?**

   `useCallback` memoizes a function to prevent it from being recreated on every render. This can avoid unnecessary re-renders in child components that receive the function as a prop.

---

## useMemo vs useCallback

15. **When should you use `useMemo` vs `useCallback`?**

   - Use `useMemo` to memoize values like expensive calculations.
   - Use `useCallback` to memoize functions passed as props to child components.

---

## Redux vs useState

16. **How does Redux differ from React’s built-in state management using `useState`?**

   - **Redux** is a centralized state management solution for global state.
   - **useState** manages local component-specific state.

---

## Side Effects in React

17. **What are side effects in React, and how do you handle them?**

   Side effects are actions that interact with external systems (e.g., API calls, DOM manipulation). They are managed using the `useEffect` hook.

---

## Alternatives to Redux

18. **What are the alternatives to Redux for state management in React?**

   - **Context API**: Simplifies global state management without Redux’s complexity.
   - **MobX**: A more declarative way to manage state.
   - **Recoil**: A modern state management library for fine-grained control.
